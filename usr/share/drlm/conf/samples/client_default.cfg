# Default output target
# DRLM v2.4.0 only supports PXE and ISO outputs
#
#OUTPUT=PXE

# SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD defines a password for remote access to the recovery system as 'root' via SSH
# without requiring a public/private key pair. This password is valid only while the recovery system
# is running and will not allow access afterwards to the restored target system.
# In the recovery system the password is stored in hashed MD5 format (do not forget the password).
# Both SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='plain_text_password' and SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='hashed_password' are possible.
# To avoid a plain text password in the etc/rear/local.conf config file
# generate a hashed password with the command
#   echo 'my_recovery_system_root_password' | openssl passwd -1 -stdin
# and use the output of openssl to set SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='output_of_openssl'
# (single quotes avoid issues with the special bash character $ in the openssl output).
# SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD is ignored when SSH_FILES is set to a 'false' value.
#
#SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD='drlm'

# Additional DRLM Configurations #
##################################

# ================================
# ==== History Backup files ======
# ================================

# Max numbers of backups for client backup configration to keep in filesystem
#
#HISTBKPMAX=2

# ================================
# ===== Incremental Backups ======
# ================================

# DRLM_INCREMENTAL by defautl incremental backups are disabled. Put
# this var to "yes" in order to enable
#
#DRLM_INCREMENTAL="yes"

# DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST defines how many snaps to save
#
#DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST=6

# DRLM_INCREMENTAL_BEHAVIOR 
# 0 - Always incremental. When DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST is exceeded deletes the oldest snap. HISTBKPMAX is ignored.
# 1 - New and empty DR File. When DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST is exceeded makes a New and empty DR File before runbackup
# 2 - New inherited DR File. When DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST is exceeded makes a New DR File from last backup. 
#
#DRLM_INCREMENTAL_BEHAVIOR=1

# So than incremental backups make sense, it is important that the backup
# program configured in ReaR make differential or folder synchronization 
# copies. So you need to set then BACKUP_PROG of ReaR client configuration
# to one program like RSYNC. If the default BACKUP_PROG, that is TAR, is left,
# the "runbackup" does not fail but it doesn't make sense to snap where there's
# a different tar file every time.
#
#BACKUP_PROG=rsync

# ================================
# ======= Pretty Options =========
# ================================

# Backups of less than BACKUP_SIZE_STATUS_FAILED in megabytes will show in red color in list backups
#
#BACKUP_SIZE_STATUS_FAILED=200

# Backups of less than BACKUP_SIZE_STATUS_WARNING in megabytes will show in orange color in list backups
#
#BACKUP_SIZE_STATUS_WARNING=800

# Backups that take less than BACKUP_TIME_STATUS_FAILED in seconds will show in red color in list backups
#
#BACKUP_TIME_STATUS_FAILED="60"

# Backups that take less than BACKUP_TIME_STATUS_WARNING in secods will show in orange color in list backups
#
#BACKUP_TIME_STATUS_WARNING="120"

# Additional ReaR Configurations #
##################################

# ================================
# ========== Data Only ===========
# ================================

# When BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE is set to a 'true' value
# only what is specified in BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE will be in the backup
# but not implicitly also all local filesystems as defined in mountpoint_device:
#
# BACKUP_ONLY_INCLUDE="yes"
# BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/home/*' )

# ================================
# ========= Exclusions ===========
# ================================

# Exclude LVM2 volume groups. This will automatically exclude also the creation of the
# corresponding physical and logical volumes that belong to the excluded volume group.
# You must also exclude the corresponding mountpoints in EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS (see above)
# otherwise "rear recover" would try to recreate the filesystems onto non-existing LVs.
#
# EXCLUDE_VG=( 'Volume_Grup1' 'Volume_Grup2' )

# Exclude filesystems by specifying their mountpoints. Will be automatically added to the
# $BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array during backup to prevent the excluded filesystems' data to
# be backed up
#
# EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS=( '/Mount_Point1' '/Mount_Point2' )

# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE is an array of strings that get written into a backup-exclude.txt file
# that is used e.g. in 'tar -X backup-exclude.txt' to get things excluded from the backup.
# Proper quoting of the BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE array members is crucial to avoid bash expansions.
# In /etc/rear/local.conf use BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE+=( '/this/*' '/that/*' )
# to specify your particular items that should be excluded from the backup in addition to what
# gets excluded from the backup by default here (see also BACKUP_ONLY_EXCLUDE below):
#
# BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE+=( '/backup*' '/var/lib/rear/*' '/dev/vx/*' '/dev/dmpconfig/*' '/dev/dmpconfig' '/dev/vx/dmpconfig' )

# When BACKUP_ONLY_EXCLUDE is set to a 'true' value
# only what is specified in BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE will be excluded from the backup
# but not implicitly also all excluded mountpoints in EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS:
#
# BACKUP_ONLY_EXCLUDE="no"

# ================================
# ========= Inclusions ===========
# ================================

# Only include LVM2 volume groups - the opposite of EXCLUDE_VG (handy if you only want vg00 to be included)
# EXCLUDE_VG and EXCLUDE_MOUNTPOINTS will get populated automatically, if needed
# syntax : e.g. ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( "vg00" "vg01" )
#
# ONLY_INCLUDE_VG=( 'Volume_Grup1' 'Volume_Grup2' )


# ================================
# ======== Custom Scripts ========
# ================================

# NOTE: The scripts can be defined as an array to better handly spaces in parameters.
# The scripts are called like this: eval "${PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT[@]}"

# Call this after Relax-and-Recover did everything in the recover workflow.
# Use $TARGET_FS_ROOT (by default '/mnt/local') to refer to the recovered system.
#
#POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=

# Call this before Relax-and-Recover starts to do anything in the recover workflow. You have the rescue system but nothing else
#
#PRE_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=

# PRE/POST Backup scripts will provide the ability to run certain tasks before and after a ReaR backup.
# for example:
#   If a small database running on local filesystem and dependent on a local service, you will maintain its data consistency.
#   Stopping it before backup and restarting again after.
#   In case of any error during backup, if POST tasks were defined, ReaR will run those POST tasks within ExitTasks Array.
#   This will prevent that the database remain stopped.

# Call this after Relax-and-Recover finished to do anything in the mkbackup/mkbackuponly workflow.
#
#POST_BACKUP_SCRIPT=

# Call this before Relax-and-Recover starts to do anything in the mkbackup/mkbackuponly workflow.
#
#PRE_BACKUP_SCRIPT=


# ================================
# ======== Boot Over SAN =========
# ================================

# Use this setup if your client boot disks are not internal but in a SAN/Disk Cabinet.

#AUTOEXCLUDE_MULTIPATH=n
#BOOT_OVER_SAN=y
#MODULES=( ${MODULES[@]} dm-multipath )
#MODULES_LOAD=( ${MODULES_LOAD[@]} dm-multipath )


# ================================
# ======= SLES with BTRFS ========
# ================================

# NOTE: This config was tested and works for latest SLE12 and SLE15 systems with default BTRFS layouts.
#       Check carefully your BTRFS layout, as SUSE changed it on each SP iteration since they relaesed it
#       first time in SLES11 until they met the actual layout. If your systems were upgraded from thesie early
#       versions with BTRFS check your layout properly to adjust the configuration for a success recover.

#REQUIRED_PROGS=( ${REQUIRED_PROGS[@]} 'snapper' 'chattr' 'lsattr' )
#COPY_AS_IS=( ${COPY_AS_IS[@]} '/usr/lib/snapper/installation-helper' '/etc/snapper/config-templates/default' )
#BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/' )
#BACKUP_PROG_EXCLUDE=( '/.snapshots' )
#POST_RECOVERY_SCRIPT=( 'if snapper --no-dbus -r $TARGET_FS_ROOT get-config | grep -q "^QGROUP.*[0-9]/[0-9]" ; then snapper --no-dbus -r $TARGET_FS_ROOT set-config QGROUP= ; snapper --no-dbus -r $TARGET_FS_ROOT setup-quota && echo snapper setup-quota done || echo snapper setup-quota failed ; else echo snapper setup-quota not used ; fi' )


# =======================================
# ======= Complex Network setups ========
# =======================================

# If you have complex network setups on your systems you may need to setup your network in recovery before starting the recover process.
# This is an example of a system with vlan tagging. Check if your HW vendor supports this kind of setup in UEFI to be able to
# set a default VLAN ID in a NIC for bootingi when tagging/trunk is enabled.
# Here the example to auto conrfigure the complex setup in recovery:
#   VLAN ID of DRLM network: 2011
#   DRLM Client IP address: 192.168.0.10/24
#   Network Interface Card: eno50

#NETWORKING_PREPARATION_COMMANDS=( 'modprobe 8021q' 'ip link add link eno50 name eno50.2011 type vlan id 2011' 'ip link set dev eno50 up' 'ip link set dev eno50.2011 up' 'ip addr add 192.168.0.10/24 brd 192.168.0.255 dev eno50.2011' 'return' )
