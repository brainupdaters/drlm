# DRLM v2.4.11
# 

# This configuration example does a data backup of /home directory of the 
# client. You can copy this file into /etc/drlm/clients/client_name.cfg.d/
# and then do a: 
#
# drlm runbackup -c client_name -C client_incremental_data_only
#
# This backup is incremental, so if you run again runbakup only the files that
# have changed will be tranferred.

# ================================
# ===== Incremental Backups ======
# ================================

# DRLM_INCREMENTAL by defautl incremental backups are disables. Put
# this var to "yes" in order to enable
#
DRLM_INCREMENTAL="yes"

# DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST defines how many snaps to save
#
#DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST=6

# DRLM_INCREMENTAL_BEHAVIOR 
# 0 - Always incremental. When DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST is exceeded deletes the oldest snap. HISTBKPMAX is ignored.
# 1 - New and empty DR File. When DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST is exceeded makes a New and empty DR File before runbackup
# 2 - New inherited DR File. When DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST is exceeded makes a New DR File from last backup.

# ========== Data Only ===========

# When DRLM_BKP_TYPE is set to a 'DATA' value
# only what is specified in BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE will be in the backup
# but not implicitly also all local filesystems as defined in mountpoint_device:
#
BACKUP_PROG_INCLUDE=( '/home' )
