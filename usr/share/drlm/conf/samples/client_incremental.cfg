# ===== Incremental Backups ======
# ================================

# DRLM_INCREMENTAL by defautl incremental backups are disables. Put
# this var to "yes" in order to enable
#
DRLM_INCREMENTAL="yes"

# DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST defines how many snaps to save
#
DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST=6

# DRLM_INCREMENTAL_BEHAVIOR 
# 0 - Always incremental. When DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST is exceeded deletes the oldest snap. HISTBKPMAX is ignored.
# 1 - New and empty DR File. When DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST is exceeded makes a New and empty DR File before runbackup
# 2 - New inherited DR File. When DRLM_INCREMENTAL_HIST is exceeded makes a New DR File from last backup. 
#
DRLM_INCREMENTAL_BEHAVIOR=1

# So than incremental backups make sense, it is important that the backup program configured in ReaR 
# make differential or folder synchronization copies. So you need to set then BACKUP_PROG of ReaR client
# configuration to one program like RSYNC. If the default BACKUP_PROG, that is TAR, is left, the "runbackup"
# does not fail but it doesn't make sense to snap where there's a different tar file every time.
#
BACKUP_PROG=rsync
