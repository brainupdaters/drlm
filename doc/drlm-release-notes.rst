System and Software Requirements
--------------------------------

As DRLM has been solely written in the bash language we need the
bash shell which is standard available on all GNU/Linux based systems.

Also requires some system services in order to work properly:

  * isc-dhcpd
  * nfs-server
  * tftpd
  * apache2
  * qemu-img
  * sqlite3

All other required programs (like sort, dd, grep, etc.) are so common, that
we don't list them as requirements. In case your specific workflow requires
additional tools, Disaster Recovery Linux Manager will tell you.

DRLM is a tool to manage REAR systems, so all clients need REAR package and
its dependencies to work properly.

please visit: http://docs.drlm.org


Support
-------

Disaster Recovery Linux Manager (DRLM) is an Open Source project under GPLv3
license which means it is free to use and modify. However, the creators of DRLM
have spent many, many hours in development and support. We will only give
free of charge support in our free time (and when work/home balance allows it).

That does not mean we let our user basis in the cold as we do deliver support
as a service (not free of charge).


Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------

DRLM is supported on the following Linux based operating systems:

  * RHEL 6 and 7
  * CentOS 6 and 7
  * Debian 7, 8 and 9
  * Ubuntu 14 and 16
  * SLES 12 SP1

If you require support for any unsupported Linux Operating System you must
acquire a DRLM support contract.


Supported Architectures
-----------------------

DRLM is developed in Bash and should be supported on any type of processor.
If any architecture related problem appears, please open an issue.


Supported DRLM versions
-----------------------

DRLM has a short history (since 2013) but we cannot supported all released
versions. If you have a problem we urge you to install the latest
stable DRLM version or the development version (available on github) before
submitting an issue.

However, we do understand that it is not always possible to install the
latest and greatest version so we are willing to support some previous
versions of DRLM if you have a support contract.
