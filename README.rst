DRLM - Disaster Recovery Linux Manager
======================================

Disaster Recovery Linux Manager (DRLM) is a Central Management Open Source
Software for Linux Disaster Recovery and System Migrations, based on
Relax-and-Recover (ReaR).

DRLM provides Central Management and Deployment from small to large
Linux Disaster Recovery Implementations bringing a great Centralized Management
Tool to Linux SysAdmins.

With DRLM SysAdmins can add/delete/modify networks and ReaR clients to manage,
run backups and enable/disable Disaster Recovery system images to recovery
through network.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

As DRLM has been solely written in the bash language we need the
bash shell which is standard available on all GNU/Linux based systems.

Also requires some system services in order to work properly:

  * isc-dhcpd
  * nfs-server
  * rsync
  * tftpd
  * qemu-utils
  * sqlite3

All other required programs (like sort, dd, grep, etc.) are so common, that
we don't list them as requirements. In case your specific workflow requires
additional tools, Disaster Recovery Linux Manager will tell you.

DRLM is a tool to manage REAR systems, so all clients need REAR package and
its dependencies to work properly.

For detailed documentation of DRLM and all system and software requirements,
please visit: http://docs.drlm.org


INSTALLATION
------------

On RPM based systems you should use the drlm RPM package. Either obtain it
from the DRLM homepage or build it yourself from the source
tree with:
::

  $ make rpm

This will create an RPM for your distribution. The RPM is not platform-
dependant and should work also on other RPM based distributions.

On DEB based systems you can execute the command:
::

  $ make deb

CONFIGURATION
-------------

To configure Disaster Recovery Linux Manager you have to edit the configuration
files in '/etc/drlm/'. All '*.conf' files there are part of the configuration,
but only 'local.conf' are intended for the user configuration.
